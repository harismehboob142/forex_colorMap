SGraph calculates autocorrelation and potential profit (for one market share) by using autocorrelation, historical data and the following every day strategy: 

1. If you do not have shares, then buy when market opens. 

2. Set "sell limit" to: "Price at Open" x "Calculated by SGraph recommendation".





The X, Y color of colormap calculated on the basis of Time (X) and time difference between correlation intervals (Y). Red color - "good" correlation, Blue - "bad".





The following screen shot shows the autocorrelation colormap and the graphic of profit (calculated on the basis of the maximum correlation):
